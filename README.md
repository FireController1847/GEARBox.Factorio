Game-Extension Additional Resources for Factorio

## What is GEARBox?

GEARBox is a term coined by FireController#1847 to emphasize a group projects which provide utilities and enhancements for modding various video games. GEAR is an acronym which stands for *Game-Enhancement Additional Resources*.

GEARBox is not a trademarked term, and you are encouraged to use it in your projects to help identify and categorize tools for games which allow modifications (e.g. 'modding' or 'mods').

## GEARBox for Factorio

GEARBox for Factorio is a set of C# programs which have helped me when modding the [Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/) video game. It is a side project borne out of curiosity, and no support or maintenance is guaranteed, but contributions are encouraged and welcome.

## Visual Editor

A **Visual Editor** for working with tiles and pictures is available at the following URL: http://firecontroller1847.github.io/GEARBox.Factorio/

This project was made out of frustration with reloading Factorio and constantly restarting the game to make various minor tweaks to the textures. It is fully featured, has local storage support and will translate directly into your Factorio mods when moving from the editor into the game. It provides an easy frame-of-reference for tile sizings and how they will appear in-game, and allows for quick modification of tile offsets and other tweakable values.
